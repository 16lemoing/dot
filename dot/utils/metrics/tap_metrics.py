    """Computes TAP-Vid metrics (Jaccard, Pts. Within Thresh, Occ. Acc.)
    See the TAP-Vid paper for details on the metric computation.  All inputs are
    given in raster coordinates.  The first three arguments should be the direct
    outputs of the reader: the 'query_points', 'occluded', and 'target_points'.
    The paper metrics assume these are scaled relative to 256x256 images.
    pred_occluded and pred_tracks are your algorithm's predictions.
    This function takes a batch of inputs, and computes metrics separately for
    each video.  The metrics for the full benchmark are a simple mean of the
    metrics across the full set of videos.  These numbers are between 0 and 1,
    but the paper multiplies them by 100 to ease reading.
    Args:
       query_points: The query points, an in the format [t, y, x].  Its size is
         [b, n, 3], where b is the batch size and n is the number of queries
       gt_occluded: A boolean array of shape [b, n, t], where t is the number
         of frames.  True indicates that the point is occluded.
       gt_tracks: The target points, of shape [b, n, t, 2].  Each point is
         in the format [x, y]
       pred_occluded: A boolean array of predicted occlusions, in the same
         format as gt_occluded.
       pred_tracks: An array of track predictions from your algorithm, in the
         same format as gt_tracks.
       query_mode: Either 'first' or 'strided', depending on how queries are
         sampled.  If 'first', we assume the prior knowledge that all points
         before the query point are occluded, and these are removed from the
         evaluation.
    Returns:
        A dict with the following keys:
        occlusion_accuracy: Accuracy at predicting occlusion.
        pts_within_{x} for x in [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]: Fraction of points
          predicted to be within the given pixel threshold, ignoring occlusion
          prediction.
        jaccard_{x} for x in [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]: Jaccard metric for the given
          threshold
        average_pts_within_thresh: average across pts_within_{x}
        average_jaccard: average across jaccard_{x}
