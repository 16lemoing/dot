**DOT** unifies point tracking and optical flow techniques:
- It tracks all pixels in a frame simultaneously
- It retains the robustness to occlusions and the accuracy of point tracking techniques
- It enjoys the spatial consistency and runs at a comparable speed to optical flow techniques

### ðŸŽ… Release Plan
The DOT code is set to unwrap just in time for Christmas ðŸŽ„.
